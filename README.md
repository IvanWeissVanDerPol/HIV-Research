# HIV Evolution Under Multi-Pressure Selection: A Computational Geometry Approach

**Audience**: Clinicians, Virologists, Immunologists, Vaccine Researchers  
**Format**: Medical-oriented findings without implementation details

---

## About This Document Collection

This collection presents findings from a large-scale computational analysis of HIV evolution under multiple selective pressures. The research integrates five major HIV databases (202,085 total records) to understand how the virus evolves in response to:

- **Antiretroviral therapy** (drug resistance pressure)
- **Cellular immunity** (CTL/CD8+ T-cell pressure)
- **Humoral immunity** (antibody pressure)
- **Tropism requirements** (coreceptor usage)

Our computational approach models genetic changes as movements in a geometric space, allowing us to quantify "evolutionary distance" between mutations and predict viral behavior.

## Key Discoveries

### Novel Findings

1. **Position 22 in V3 Loop**: We identified position 22 as the strongest tropism determinant, exceeding the classic 11/25 rule
2. **328 Safe Vaccine Targets**: Epitopes with broad HLA coverage that avoid drug resistance conflict
3. **Geometric Resistance Prediction**: 78% accuracy classifying primary vs. accessory mutations using geometric features alone
4. **Quantified Trade-offs**: 16,054 positions where drug resistance and immune escape pressures conflict

### Confirmed (Validates Methodology)

- B*57 and B*27 as protective HLA alleles
- The 11/25 tropism rule (independently recovered)
- Known bnAb breadth and potency profiles
- Protein conservation hierarchy (Gag > Pol > Env > Nef)

## Clinical Relevance

This research provides:

- **Treatment optimization**: Understanding which resistance mutations require larger genetic changes helps predict durability of ART regimens
- **Vaccine design**: Identifying epitopes that are both immunogenic and resistant to viral escape
- **Prognostic markers**: Geometric signatures that correlate with disease progression
- **Cure research**: Mapping evolutionary constraints that limit viral adaptation
