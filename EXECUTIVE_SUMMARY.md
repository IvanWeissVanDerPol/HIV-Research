# Executive Summary: HIV Multi-Pressure Evolution Analysis

**For**: Clinicians, Virologists, and Vaccine Researchers  
**Datasets**: 202,085 records across 5 major HIV databases

---

## Overview

We conducted a comprehensive computational analysis of HIV evolution under simultaneous selective pressures from antiretroviral therapy, cellular immunity (CTL), humoral immunity (antibodies), and coreceptor tropism requirements. By modeling genetic changes geometrically, we quantified the "evolutionary cost" of mutations and identified patterns with direct clinical implications.

## Major Findings Summary

### 1. Drug Resistance: Why Some Mutations Emerge Faster

**Key Insight**: The genetic distance a mutation must traverse correlates with how quickly resistance emerges.

| Drug Class | Mean Genetic Distance | Clinical Implication |
|:-----------|----------------------:|:---------------------|
| NRTI | 6.08 (highest) | Resistance requires substantial genetic reorganization |
| NNRTI | 5.04 (moderate) | Single mutations can confer resistance (e.g., K103N) |
| PI | Variable (std=2.34) | Wide range due to accessory mutation requirements |
| INSTI | 4.92 (moderate) | DTG maintains high genetic barrier |

**Notable Mutations**:
- **K103N** (NNRTI): Low genetic distance (3.80) explains rapid emergence
- **M46I** (PI): Exceptionally low distance (0.65) as accessory mutation
- **T215Y** (NRTI): High distance (7.17) reflects major genetic shift

**Clinical Value**: We achieved 78.3% accuracy in classifying primary vs. accessory mutations using geometric features alone, providing a new framework for predicting resistance pathways.

### 2. Immune Escape: Why B*57 and B*27 Protect

**Key Insight**: Protective HLA alleles restrict epitopes where escape mutations require larger genetic changes.

| HLA Allele | Escape Velocity | Protection Level |
|:-----------|----------------:|:-----------------|
| B*57 | 0.218 (slowest) | Very High |
| B*27 | 0.256 | High |
| A*02 | 0.342 | High |
| A*03 | 0.389 | Moderate |

**Finding**: 77.8% of successful immune escape mutations cross major cluster boundaries in our geometric space, indicating that effective escape requires substantial genetic reorganization.

**Protein Constraint Hierarchy**:

| Protein | Conservation Level | Escape Rate |
|:--------|:-------------------|------------:|
| Gag | Highest | 0.28 (slowest) |
| Pol | High | 0.31 |
| Env | Moderate | 0.45 |
| Nef | Lowest | 0.52 (fastest) |

This explains why Gag-targeting CTL responses are associated with viral control.

### 3. Tropism: New Position 22 Discovery

**Key Insight**: Position 22 in the V3 loop is the strongest tropism determinant, exceeding the canonical 11/25 rule.

| V3 Position | Tropism Discrimination Score | Traditional Focus |
|:------------|-----------------------------:|:------------------|
| **22** | **0.591** | Not emphasized (NEW) |
| 8 | 0.432 | Supporting role |
| 20 | 0.406 | Coreceptor contact |
| 11 | 0.341 | Classic 11/25 rule |
| 25 | 0.314 | Classic 11/25 rule |

**Location**: Position 22 sits at the V3 crown tip, directly contacting the coreceptor. Charge changes (basic amino acids R/K) at this position strongly predict CXCR4 tropism.

**Tropism Classifier Performance**:
- Our model: 85% accuracy, AUC 0.86
- Classic 11/25 rule: 74% accuracy
- Comparable to Geno2pheno: 84%

**Clinical Relevance**: X4 tropism emergence is associated with faster disease progression. Position 22 may be a valuable addition to clinical tropism assessment.

### 4. Antibody Neutralization: What Makes bnAbs Effective

**Key Insight**: Broadly neutralizing antibodies target geometrically central (highly conserved) epitopes.

| Antibody | Breadth | IC50 (μg/mL) | Epitope Class |
|:---------|--------:|-------------:|:--------------|
| 3BNC117 | 78.8% | 0.242 | CD4 binding site |
| 10E8 | 76.7% | 0.221 | MPER |
| VRC01 | 68.9% | 0.580 | CD4 binding site |
| PG9 | 70.9% | 0.300 | V2-glycan |
| PGT121 | 59.2% | 0.566 | V3-glycan |

**Epitope Class Potency** (by IC50):
1. V2-glycan (0.689 μg/mL) - most potent
2. V3-glycan (0.745 μg/mL)
3. CD4 binding site (1.121 μg/mL)
4. MPER (1.815 μg/mL)
5. Interface (3.597 μg/mL)

**Finding**: Antibody breadth correlates with epitope centrality (r=0.68, p<0.001). This geometric relationship can guide bnAb design toward conserved targets.

### 5. Vaccine Targets: 328 Safe Epitopes Identified

**Key Insight**: We identified 328 CTL epitopes suitable for vaccine development that:
- Have broad HLA restriction (≥3 alleles)
- Show low escape velocity
- Contain NO drug resistance mutation overlap
- Are highly conserved across viral populations

**Top 5 Vaccine Candidates**:

| Rank | Epitope | Protein | HLA Coverage | Score |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|-------------:|------:|
| 1 | TPQDLNTML | Gag | 25 alleles | 2.238 |
| 2 | AAVDLSHFL | Nef | 19 alleles | 1.701 |
| 3 | YPLTFGWCF | Nef | 19 alleles | 1.701 |
| 4 | YFPDWQNYT | Nef | 19 alleles | 1.701 |
| 5 | QVPLRPMTYK | Nef | 19 alleles | 1.701 |

**Why "Safe"?**: These epitopes avoid the 16,054 positions where drug resistance mutations overlap with CTL epitopes, preventing selection pressure conflicts during treatment.

### 6. Trade-offs: When Pressures Conflict

**Key Insight**: 16,054 instances exist where drug resistance mutations fall within CTL epitopes, affecting 3,074 unique positions and 298 epitopes.

**Highest Trade-off Positions**:

| Mutation | Drug Class | Overlapping Epitopes | HLAs Affected | Trade-off Score |
|:---------|:-----------|---------------------:|--------------:|----------------:|
| S283R | INSTI | RT epitope | 15 | 5.63 |
| D67NS | NNRTI | RT epitope | 15 | 5.55 |
| Q61NH | PI | RT epitope | 15 | 5.52 |

**Clinical Implication**: Patients with these HLA types may experience altered immune control when resistance mutations emerge at overlapping positions. This creates opportunities for personalized treatment strategies.

1. **Drug resistance emergence speed** can be predicted by genetic distance
2. **Protective HLA alleles** restrict epitopes in evolutionarily constrained regions
3. **Position 22** should be considered in tropism assessment alongside 11/25
4. **328 epitopes** represent safe vaccine targets without resistance conflicts
5. **Trade-off mapping** enables personalized treatment based on HLA type
