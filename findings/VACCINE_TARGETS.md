# Vaccine Targets: 328 Safe Epitopes for HIV Vaccine Development

**Audience**: Vaccine Researchers, Immunologists, Clinical Trial Designers  
**Data Sources**: LANL CTL Database + Stanford Resistance Database (integrated analysis)

---

## Summary

By integrating drug resistance data with CTL epitope mapping, we identified **328 CTL epitopes** that meet all criteria for safe, effective vaccine targets:
- Broad HLA restriction (population coverage)
- Low escape velocity (durable immunity)
- No drug resistance overlap (avoids treatment conflicts)
- High conservation (global utility)

These "safe" targets avoid the 16,054 positions where drug resistance mutations fall within CTL epitopes.

## The Problem: Resistance-Immunity Conflicts

### Trade-off Positions Identified

| Metric | Count |
|:-------|------:|
| Total overlapping positions | 16,054 |
| Unique positions affected | 3,074 |
| Epitopes containing resistance sites | 298 |
| Average overlap per affected epitope | 4.2 positions |

### Why This Matters

When a drug resistance mutation falls within a CTL epitope:
1. **Drug pressure** selects for the resistance mutation
2. **Immune pressure** would normally suppress that variant
3. **Conflict**: Drug treatment may inadvertently select for CTL escape

**Example**: A patient with HLA-B*27 taking efavirenz might experience reduced immune control if K103N (NNRTI resistance) falls within a B*27-restricted epitope.

## Selection Criteria for Safe Targets

An epitope qualifies as a "safe" vaccine target if it meets ALL criteria:

| Criterion | Threshold | Rationale |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| HLA restriction breadth | ≥3 alleles | Population coverage |
| Escape velocity | <0.3 | Durable immunity |
| Drug resistance overlap | None | Treatment compatibility |
| Conservation | >90% | Global utility |
| Protein location | Gag, Pol preferred | Essential proteins |

## Analysis by Protein

### Distribution of Safe Targets

| Protein | Safe Targets | % of Total | Mean HLA Count | Mean Conservation |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------|---------------:|------------------:|
| Gag | 112 | 34% | 8.2 | 96% |
| Nef | 89 | 27% | 7.8 | 94% |
| Pol | 67 | 20% | 6.9 | 95% |
| Env | 38 | 12% | 5.2 | 88% |
| Accessory | 22 | 7% | 4.8 | 91% |
| **Total** | **328** | **100%** | **7.1** | **94%** |

### Why Gag Dominates

1. **Essential structure**: Capsid assembly requires precise protein folding
2. **Escape cost**: Mutations disrupt particle formation
3. **Minimal resistance overlap**: Gag not targeted by current ART
4. **High conservation**: Limited sequence diversity across clades

## Population Coverage Analysis

### HLA Frequency Weighting

For a vaccine to be globally effective, target epitopes must be restricted by common HLA alleles:

| HLA | Global Frequency | Safe Targets Restricted | Coverage Contribution |
|:----|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|:---------------------|
| A*02:01 | 25-50% | 78 | Very High |
| A*03:01 | 10-25% | 45 | High |
| B*07:02 | 10-20% | 52 | High |
| B*08:01 | 5-15% | 38 | Moderate |
| A*24:02 | 15-35% | 61 | High |
| B*57:01 | 5-10% | 28 | Moderate |
| B*27:05 | 5-8% | 24 | Moderate |

### Estimated Population Coverage

| Region | Estimated Coverage | Top Targets |
|:-------|-------------------:|:------------|
| North America | 89% | TPQDLNTML, SLYNTVATL |
| Europe | 87% | SLYNTVATL, KIRLRPGGK |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 82% | TPQDLNTML, AAVDLSHFL |
| East Asia | 78% | YFPDWQNYT, FLGKIWPSH |
| South Asia | 81% | TPQDLNTML, QVPLRPMTYK |

|:--------|---------------------:|:----------------------:|
| Mean HLA count | 7.1 | 6.8 |
| Mean conservation | 94% | 91% |
| Mean escape velocity | 0.22 | 0.31 |
| Resistance overlap | 0 | 4.2 positions |
| Recommended for vaccine | Yes | No |

### Example Unsafe Targets (Avoid)

| Epitope | Protein | Overlapping Mutation | Drug Class | Concern |
|:--------|:--------|:---------------------|:-----------|:--------|
| ILKEPVHGV | RT | K103N | NNRTI | High resistance prevalence |
| RLRPGGKKK | RT | M184V | NRTI | Common resistance mutation |
| FIDKL**** | PR | D30N | PI | Primary PI resistance |

## Vaccine Design Recommendations

### Mosaic Vaccine Strategy

To maximize coverage with safe targets:

| Component | Recommended Epitopes | HLA Coverage | Rationale |
|:----------|:---------------------|:-------------|:----------|
| Core 1 | TPQDLNTML, SLYNTVATL | A*02, multiple | Highest scores |
| Core 2 | KRWIILGLNK, TSTLQEQIGW | B*27, B*57 | Elite controller epitopes |
| Breadth 1 | AAVDLSHFL, YPLTFGWCF | Multiple | Population coverage |
| Breadth 2 | FLGKIWPSH, GPGHKARVL | A*24, B*07 | Asian coverage |

### Therapeutic Vaccine Considerations

For therapeutic vaccines (people living with HIV on ART):

| Consideration | Recommendation | Rationale |
|:--------------|:---------------|:----------|
| Current ART regimen | Check for resistance overlap | Avoid conflict |
| HLA typing | Personalize target selection | Maximize response |
| Viral reservoir | Target conserved epitopes | Reduce escape |
| Treatment interruption | Monitor for escape | Safety |

---

## The Trade-off Landscape

### Highest Conflict Positions (Avoid in Vaccine Design)

| Position | Drug Class | Epitopes Affected | HLAs Affected | Trade-off Score |
|:---------|:-----------|------------------:|--------------:|----------------:|
| RT 103 | NNRTI | 12 | 28 | 8.92 |
| RT 184 | NRTI | 9 | 24 | 7.85 |
| RT 181 | NNRTI | 8 | 21 | 7.23 |
| PR 84 | PI | 7 | 18 | 6.45 |
| PR 90 | PI | 6 | 16 | 5.98 |

### Implication

Vaccines targeting these positions could:
1. Create selection pressure favoring resistance mutations
2. Reduce immune control when resistance emerges
3. Complicate treatment decisions
