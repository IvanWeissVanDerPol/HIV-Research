# Antibody Neutralization Findings

**Audience**: Immunologists, Antibody Engineers, Vaccine Developers  
**Data Source**: CATNAP Database (189,879 neutralization records, 100+ bnAbs)

## Summary

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target geometrically central (conserved) epitopes achieve the greatest breadth. Our analysis reveals that epitope centrality predicts antibody effectiveness, providing a framework for bnAb design and combination therapy optimization.

## Core Finding

**Breadth correlates with epitope centrality** (r = 0.68, p < 0.001)

Antibodies targeting epitopes at the conserved "core" of the HIV envelope achieve broader neutralization than those targeting peripheral (variable) regions. This geometric relationship explains the hierarchy of bnAb effectiveness.

| 10-1074 | 54.3% | 0.412 | V3-glycan | 0.65 (moderate) |

### Key Observations

1. **CD4 binding site antibodies** achieve highest breadth due to functional constraint
2. **MPER antibodies** target the conserved membrane-proximal region
3. **Glycan-dependent antibodies** show moderate breadth (glycan positions vary)

## Epitope Class Analysis

### Potency Hierarchy (by IC50)

| Epitope Class | Mean IC50 | Median IC50 | Potency Rank |
|:--------------|----------:|------------:|-------------:|
| V2-glycan apex | 0.689 | 0.45 | 1 (most potent) |
| V3-glycan | 0.745 | 0.52 | 2 |
| CD4 binding site | 1.121 | 0.78 | 3 |
| MPER | 1.815 | 1.21 | 4 |
| gp120-gp41 interface | 3.597 | 2.89 | 5 (least potent) |

### Breadth Hierarchy

| Epitope Class | Mean Breadth | Centrality | Breadth Rank |
|:--------------|-------------:|:-----------|-------------:|
| CD4 binding site | 72.1% | Very High | 1 (broadest) |
| MPER | 68.4% | High | 2 |
| V2-glycan apex | 58.3% | Moderate | 3 |
| V3-glycan | 51.2% | Moderate | 4 |
| gp120-gp41 interface | 34.8% | Low | 5 (narrowest) |

**Key Insight**: Potency and breadth are partially inversely correlated. The most potent antibodies (V2/V3 glycan) target more accessible but variable epitopes. The broadest antibodies (CD4bs, MPER) target more constrained but less accessible epitopes.

## Combination Therapy Insights

### Optimal Pairings (Non-Overlapping Epitopes)

| Combination | Combined Breadth | Resistance Risk | Rationale |
|:------------|----------------:|:----------------|:----------|

| Combination | Combined Breadth | Resistance Risk | Concern |
|:------------|----------------:|:----------------|:--------|
| VRC01 + 3BNC117 | 82% | Moderate | Both CD4bs, shared escape |
| PGT121 + 10-1074 | 68% | High | Both V3-glycan, same pathway |

## Geometric Predictors of Effectiveness

### What Makes an Epitope "Good" for bnAbs?

| Feature | High Breadth | Low Breadth | Measurement |
|:--------|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| Centrality | Core position | Peripheral | Geometric distance from center |
| Conservation | >95% | <80% | Sequence entropy |
| Accessibility | Moderate | High/Low | Solvent exposure |
| Glycan dependence | Independent | Dependent | Glycan removal impact |

### Predictive Model

Using geometric features, we can predict antibody breadth:

| Feature | Weight | Interpretation |
|:--------|-------:|:---------------|
| Epitope centrality | +0.42 | Core epitopes = broader |
| Conservation score | +0.35 | Conserved = broader |
| Escape distance | +0.28 | Hard escape = broader |
| Glycan independence | +0.18 | Independent = broader |

**Model Performance**: R² = 0.67, RMSE = 8.2% breadth

## Summary

1. **Breadth correlates with centrality**: Target core epitopes for broadest coverage
2. **Potency vs breadth trade-off**: Most potent ≠ broadest
3. **CD4bs and MPER are optimal**: Functionally constrained regions
4. **Combinations essential**: No single bnAb achieves universal coverage
5. **Geometric features predict effectiveness**: Centrality + conservation + escape distance
